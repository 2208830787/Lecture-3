## R Markdown

# R Markdown

# This is my level 1 heading

## This is my level 2 heading

### This is my level 3 heading

#### This is my level 4 heading

This is my main text. POLI3148 is cool.

# Add code to your document

```{r}
log(50)
```

# Output Figures

```{r}
plot(1:10, 1:10)
```

# Display Data

```{r}
cars
```

# In-line R code

scientific research shows that 12223 + 12111 = `r 12223 + 12111`.

```{r}
#install.packages('tinytex')
#tinytex::install_tinytex()
```

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
